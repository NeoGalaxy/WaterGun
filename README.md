# WaterGun : a Water Fun grid solver

This was a project for our second year of studies. It is a Water Fun grid solver.  
Water Fun is a game where you have a grid with walls on the sides for only certain cells. There are also numbers on the sides of the grid. The goal is to fill the grid with water such that the numbers on the side of a line or column is the number of water cells on said row/column. But there is a constraint when filling the cells : all the cells that are connected should have the same level of water, as if it could flow from the top of the cell to the bottom. So you can't have an empty cell under a water cell (otherwise the water would fall), and you can't have an empty cell next to a water cell, assuming there is no wall between said cells.

### Dependencies

This project has been developed using Python 3.6.9 and above, and will surely be incompatible with older versions than Python 3.5. Contact [Gwennan](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy) if you need compatibility to a certain version.  
It also uses the module [pycosat](https://pypi.org/project/pycosat/), be sure to install it using `pip3 install pycosat` (or maybe `pip install pycosat`) before using this project.
(Other dependencies : io, warnings, itertools, json, os, subprocess. Theses modules are built-in.)

## Usage

You have 3 ways to use our solver : 
1. Launch the interpreter [`main.py`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/main.py) after moving the grid(s) you want to resolve into the directory [`/Grids`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Grids) or set the *path to the grids to read* configuration to the directory where your grid is located if it is not already done.
2. Write some script in the directory [`/Tests`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Tests). 
3. Copy the directory [`/Classes`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Classes) into your project, and use it in your scripts.

### The interpreter

In the interpreter, you can import one or many grids from the directory [`/Grids/Probs`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Grids/Probs) (or from any other directory by changing the configuration), export them as SVG images and export their solutions also in SVG, to the directory [`/Outputs`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Outputs) (also a customizable configuration). 
You can refer to the `help` command to see how to use the interpreter. 

Here is an example of commands to load `example.grid`, and give one of its solutions in the file `Grids/Solutions/exampleSol.svg` :
```
config
2
Grids/Solutions
q
load example.grid example
solve exampleSol y
exit
```
> Advice : on terminal, you can use `ledit python3 main.py` instead of just `python3 main.py` to allow using the arrows to navigate on the command line and in the history.

### Scripting

For the two other solutions, you will need to first import the classes. If you are in the directory [`/Grids`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Grids), you can simply import `classes.py` or import from it the classes you need:
```python
from classes import *
```
Otherwise, you'll need to import the directory [`/Classes`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Classes). If it is in your current directory, you can simply do the following :
```python
from Classes import *
```
Otherwise, you'll have to find a way to import it (like done in `classes.py`).

Now that the classes are imported, to create a grid from a file or a string, use the class `Grid`. The `Grid` class' constructor can take many different kinds of variables as argument, here is an example with each possibility:
```python
from classes import Grid #assuming you are in /Tests
gridN1 = Grid("../Grids/Probs/grid1.grid")
with f as open("../Grids/Probs/example.grid")
	gridN2 = Grid(f)
with f as open("../Grids/Probs/grid2x5N.grid")
	txt = f.read()
	gridN3 = Grid(txt)
print("grid number 1 : ",gridN1) # -> "(6x6 grid)"
print(gridN1.getGrid()) # print the grid in grid1 format
print("grid number 2 : ",gridN2) # -> "(6x6 grid)"
print(gridN2.getGrid()) # print the grid in grid1 format
print("grid number 3 : ",gridN3) # -> "(6x6 grid)"
print(gridN3.getGrid()) # print the grid in grid1 format
```
> Here is the `help(Grid.__init__)`, explaining the types of inputs possible :
> ```python
> __init__(self, arg)
>     Parse a specified grid.
>     The arg should be of type :
>     - 'str' if it contains a path to a grid or the content of the grid itself
>     - '_io.TextIOWrapper' if the opened file contains the grid
>     - 'list' if it contains each line of the grid
> ```

Now, to get a solution, just use `Grid.getSolution()`. The return value of this call is a list of strings, each string being of the form `"i,j"` or `"-i,j"`, `i` and `j` being the coordinates of the tile from the bottom left. If there is a `-`, then the tile should be empty, and if there is no `-`, the tile should have water (and if there is neither, this tile can be empty as well as full of water).  
You can also use `Grid.getNextSolution()`, which gives a new solution on each call until it returns `None` (which means there are no other solution), or `Grid.getAllSolutions()` which returns a generator (a kind of iterator) over the different solutions, or even iterate through grid (with `next()` or with a for loop). Here is an example:
```python
from classes import Grid

mygrid = Grid("../Grids/Probs/grid1x2_multiple_answer.grid")
print("Grid : \n"+mygrid.getGrid(),"\n")

######## using Grid.getSolution() ########
print("\nSingle solution :")
print(mygrid.getSolution())

######## using Grid.getAllSolution() ########
print("\nAll solutions :")
print("\n".join(str(s) for s in mygrid.getAllSolutions()))

######## using Grid.getNextSolution() ########
print("\nAll solutions by getNextSolution :")
s = ""
while s != None: # I miss do...while loops, why aren't they in python...?
	s = mygrid.getNextSolution()
	print(s)

######## using next(Grid) ########
print("\nAll solutions using next :")
try:
	while True:
		s = next(mygrid)
		print(s)
except Exception as e:
	print("-> Ended")

######## using for loop ########
print("\nAll solutions by for loop :")
for s in (mygrid):
	print(s)
```
> **/!\\** Note the following : The iterator used by Grid.getNextSolution() and next(Grid) are the same. So mixing both methods will result in iterating thought the same iterator (and **not** though two different iterators). The difference between them is that `next(Grid)` will throw an error after the last element (as expected for an iterator), whereas `Grid.getNextSolution()` will return a `None` **and reset the iterator** (allowing to re-use Grid.getNextSolution() and next(Grid) after it has returned None).

Once you have a solution, what we have done is to print it directly. But you can also visualize it in a svg image by using `Grid.writeSvg()` or `Grid.writeSvgs()`: 
```python
from classes import Grid

grille = Grid("../Grids/Probs/example.grid")
s = grille.getSolution()
f = open("../Outputs/test1.svg","w")
f.write(grille.writeSvgs(s))
f.close()

grille = Grid("../Grids/Probs/example.grid")
s = grille.getSolution()
f = open("../Outputs/test2.svg","w")
grille.writeSvg(f,s)
f.close()
```
> Note: *If no solution is given to `Grid.writeSvg()` or `Grid.writeSvgs()`, they will output a SVG representation of the grid itself. On the output, blue tiles should have water and gray tiles should not have water. They may also have white tiles, which are tiles that could either be with or without water. (These white tiles appear on grids where the tile have no rule attached to it, so when it have walls all around itself, and no vertical or horizontal value on its column/line.*

## Organization

The Grid solver is implemented in the directory [`/Classes`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Classes), see [`/Classes/README.md`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Classes/README.md) to know more.


The directory [`/Grids`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Grids) is meant to contain the different [grids to use as input](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Grids/Probs), and [their solutions](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Grids/Solutions).


The directory [`/Outputs`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Outputs) is meant to contain the svg files produced by the solver. Indeed, the solver can produce a SVG file (or a svg formatted string) to represent a grid or a grid's solution.


The directory [`/Tests`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/Tests) contains some tests using the different functionalities of the solver, as well as the file [`classes.py`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/blob/master/Tests/classes.py) allowing to import [`/Classes`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/blob/master/Classes) inside [`/Tests`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/blob/master/Tests). If you want or need to implement and test your own code, it is a good place to do it. (Be careful to keep the file `classes.py`, otherwise the other tests won't run any more)


The directory [`/InterpreterUtils`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/InterpreterUtils) contains some code used by the interpreter [`main.py`](https://github.com/NeoGalaxy/INF432/tree/master/main.py).
